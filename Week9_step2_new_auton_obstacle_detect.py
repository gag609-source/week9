# Instead of having just one destination, we now want our

# the X coordinate and the Y coordinate of a destination.

# We need a way to remember which destination the robot
# is currently trying to reach.
#
# Lists start counting at index 0, not 1.
#
# Therefore:
#   waypoints[0] is (4, 2)
#   waypoints[1] is (6, 7)
#   waypoints[2] is (2, 8)
#
# We start with index 0 because that is our first destination.

# Since current_target = 0, this retrieves waypoints[0].
#
# In other words:
#   TARGET_X = 4
#   TARGET_Y = 2
#
# Python automatically unpacks the tuple into two variables.
#
# Later, we will update these variables whenever the robot
# reaches a destination.
